// XuqRijBuh 2D Game Engine - by Victor Dods
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

XuqRijBuh is an OpenGL 2d game engine suite, written in C++, geared toward
real-time, sprite/polygon-object-based gameplay. Includes the game engine
library, as well as example game implementations. The goal is to provide an
intuitive platform for implementing gameplay.

XuqRijBuh is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.0.

Currently, XuqRijBuh is in a development phase, so no binary releases are
available yet.  Thus, only developers will be interested in downloading,
compiling, and using it.  Builds have been successfully done on

    - Linux using GCC 4.0 (3.3 probably also works)
    - Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (a free edition of which,
      called "MSVC 2005 Express" can be obtained -- possibly for a limited
      time -- at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/ )
    - In theory, Mac OS X -- XuqRijBuh should compile and run on any
      POSIX-compilant operating system, provided the necessary libraries
      are available.

In order to compile and run it, you must have several 3rd party libraries:

    - SDL 1.2 -- http://www.libsdl.org/
    - SDL_image 1.2 -- http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
    - OpenGL 1.x -- which generally comes with your OS or development tools
    - FreeType 2 -- http://www.freetype.org/

NOTE: Compiling with MSVC 2005 Express requires installation of additional
SDKs which are available from Microsoft (really only for a few very small
files which are somehow not included with Visual Studio itself).

    - Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1
    - Microsoft Platform SDK (PSDK)
