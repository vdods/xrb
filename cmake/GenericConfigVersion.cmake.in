# This file is the generic template for producing version-defining files used by cmake
# to search for specific versions of a library.  It should be used as the input file
# for configure_file, and the output filename should be ${PROJECT_NAME}ConfigVersion.cmake
# (which in this case is @PROJECT_NAME@ConfigVersion.cmake) in the root directory of the
# library.
