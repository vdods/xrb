/** @page setup_macosx Setup For Mac OS X

As of August 2006, I have had no chance to attempt a build on a Mac OS X machine,
so I can offer no expertise on how to setup a Mac-OS-X-specific build environment.
Fortunately, Mac OS X is essentially a Unix (BSD), so in theory (an untested theory)
the setup for a Linux machine should suffice.  Therefore, see @ref setup_linux "Setup For Linux".
GO NOW!
