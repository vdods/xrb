= TODO/IDEAS:
  * generating near-optimal quadtrees from their contents

NOTE: sprites/entities will be referred to as objects

= STRUCTURE OF A MAP
  * the map is made up of at least one "layer" which can contain objects.
  * layers are square.
  * there is a notion of a "main layer" which will effectively be the
    focus of the view when in-game.  pressing the keypad ENTER key will
    set the current layer to be the main layer.
  * layers can be hidden/shown as the user pleases, to reduce visual clutter.
  * the layers are ordered, and each have a "Z depth" assigned to them.
    the purpose of the order and the Z depth is to provide a parallaxing
    visual effect when moving the view around the map.
  * the notion of "parallaxing" describes moving the layers at different
    speeds as the view moves around the map to give a visual depth effect.
    this means that layers with a higher Z depth value will be scaled down
    to appear further away.
  * parallaxing can be disabled.
  * there is a notion of "wrapped space" which is the property of the map
    to loop back on itself; if you try to go off the edge of the map, you
    will be looped back onto the other side of the map.  this it to provide
    a less-confined feeling to the gameplay.
  * wrapped space can be disabled.
  * if wrapped space is enabled and parallaxing is enabled, all layer sizes
    must be positive-integer multiples of the size of the smallest layer.
  * if wrapped space is enabled and parralaxing is disabled, all layer sizes
    must be equal.

= MOVING THE VIEW AROUND THE MAP
  * the viewport can be moved around inside the map editor with the arrow
    keys, to move up, down, left and right.
  * the mouse wheel zooms the view in (mouse wheel up) and out (mouse wheel
    down).  the keypad PAGE-UP and PAGE-DOWN keys will also provide these
    functions respectively.
  * the view can be rotated counterclockwise and clockwise by using the
    mousewheel while holding down the ALT key.  the keypad SLASH and
    ASTERISK will also provide these functions respectively.
  * the view can be moved up/down/left/right by right mouse clicking and
    dragging while no meta keys are held.
  * the current editable layer can be changed by holding the ALT key down
    and pressing the keypad PLUS and MINUS keys.  PLUS goes one deeper into
    the set of layers, while MINUS goes the other way.

= GRAPHING
  * an array of grid lines will be used to measure/display the space in which
    the map editor works.  the grid lines which give the nearest scale to the
    current zoom will be used, and the grid lines of the scale below the
    current scale will be faded in/out as you move the current zoom
    closer/further from that scales.  the grid lines will be drawn on top
    of everything else to make them visible at all times.
  * the current grid scale will be referred to as the "major" grid scale,
    while the grid scale below the major scale will be referred to as the
    "minor" grid scale.
  * the number base of the grid scale will be configurable.
    1. for instance, a number base of 10 will have 9 equally-spaced,
       intermediate minor grid lines between each pair of adjacent major
       grid lines.  the change in size between each adjacent grid scale
       is a by a factor of 10.
    2. another example is for a number base of 2; it will have 1 minor
       grid line bisecting each pair of major grid lines.  the change in
       size between each adjacent grid scale is by a factor of 2.
  * the current grid scale can be changed as desired.
    1. using the PAGE UP key, the scale will be changed to the scale
       one smaller than the current scale.
    2. using the PAGE DOWN key, the scale will be changed to the scale
       one larger than the current scale.
  * there is a notion of "maximum" grid scale for a particular view zoom,
    which will act as an upper limit on which grid scale the user may
    select.  as the view zooms in, the current grid scale is adjusted so
    as not to violate this maximum grid scale limit.  the user may change
    the scale to be smaller up to a limit to be determined later.
  * the major grid lines will be drawn in light gray, while the minor
    grid lines will be drawn in dark grey, using a transparency based on
    the current zoom.  the further away from the current zoom level the
    minor grid scale is, the more transparent the lines will be.
  * to indicate the edge of the object layer, red lines will be drawn
    around the borders.

= OBJECTS
  * there are 2 types of objects:
    1. immovable, non-physics enabled, non-scripting-enabled sprites which
       are known as "static sprites".  a static sprite has properties of:
       A. position
       B. scale
       C. rotation
       D. sprite bitmap
       E. bounding radius
    2. movable, physics-enabled, scripting-enabled sprites and entities
       which are known as "entities".  a "dynamic sprite" is a subset of
       entity which is drawn with a bitmap, and is more or less tangible,
       while a pure entity is invisible.  an entity has properties of:
       A. position
       B. scale
       C. rotation angle
       D. bounding radius
       E. first moment of inertia (mass)
       F. second moment of inertia ("rotational mass")
       G. velocity (a vector value)
       H. angular velocity (a scalar value)
       I. gravitate property (acts on other entities with gravity)
       J. gravitatable property (responds to gravitational forces)
       K. textual name
  * because the space in each layer is finite, it is important to place
    all objects inside the layer's space.  objects will be allowed to be
    moved outside of the layer's space, and be saved into the map file, but
    will not be loaded into the actual game when the map is loaded.  this
    is to allow users to keep 'works in progress' in the margins of the
    map.

= ADDING OBJECTS
  * objects can only be added when there are no objects currently selected.
  * with no objects currently selected, press SPACEBAR to add an entity or
    a number of entities (a dialog will pop up with the entity's properties
    and such).
  * with no objects currently selected, press SPACEBAR while holding ALT to
    add a static sprite or a number of static sprites (a dialog will pop up
    with the static sprite's properties and such).

= CLONING OBJECTS
  * objects can be cloned only when there is at least one one object currently
    selected.
  * with at least one object currently selected, press SPACEBAR to clone all
    selected objects.  the cloned objects will appear slightly offset from
    their respective original.  the originals will be deselected, and the
    clones will be selected.

= DELETING OBJECTS
  * pressing BACKSPACE will delete all selected objects

= OBJECT DRAWING/HIGHLIGHTING
  * sprites will be drawn as normal (with their bitmaps being drawn with
    the correct position/rotation/scaling), with the bounding circles drawn
    over all bitmaps.
  * there will be a mode which makes all sprites 1/2 way (or an arbitrary
    fraction) transparent, so that the background is visible as well.
  * objects should have their bounding circles drawn for visibility
    and so the user can select them.
    1. static sprite bounding circles should be yellow.
    2. entity bounding circles should be red.
    3. dynamic sprite bounding circles should be green.
    selected objects' bounding circles should be drawn in the aforementioned
    colors but either with a thicker line and/or a white tint.  there shall
    be a small vertical line drawn through the origin of the object to clarify
    where the origin actually is.
  * angular properties (angle and angular velocity) will be visualized in
    the following manner:
    two lines of about 1.5 times the radius of the object, coming from
    the center of the entity, separated by the applicable angle.  one
    of the lines shall be at 0 radians.  there will be a line arc drawn
    between the lines at a radius halfway between the radius of the entity
    and the length of the lines.  angles of higher than 2 PI will potentially
    be drawn as an arc which spirals outward so that all loops of the arc are
    visible.  there will be a small circle at the tip of the 2nd line which
    will be used when grabbing the line for editing modes.
  * the linear velocity (vector value) will be visualized by an arrow vector
    coming from the origin of the entity.  it will be drawn in the same color
    as the entity's bounding circle, regardless of if it's selected.  there
    will be a small circle at the tip of the arrow which will be used in
    applicable editing modes.  this vector shall only be visible while in
    applicable editing modes.

= SELECTING OBJECTS
  * there is a notion of a set of selected objects, on which editing can
    be carried out.  non-selected objects cannot be edited.  a selection
    set is a subset of an object layer's object set (in other words,
    selections can't span multiple object layers).
  * selection actions operate only on a single object layer's selection
    set.  operations on one object layer's selection set do not affect
    the selection sets of other object layers.
  * selection state toggle of objects, one-at-a-time using a stationary
    right mouse click with the SHIFT key held, should occur by the
    following method:
    1. find all objects whose bounding circle was clicked upon
    2. sort the list from smallest bounding circle to largest
    3. select the first (smallest) object in the list
    this is to facilitate selection of small objects which are
    behind larger ones, where selecting them would otherwise be difficult.
  * single selection of objects will effectively clear the selection
    beforehand, so that afterwards, the single selected object is
    the only thing selected.
  * selecting multiple objects is done the following way:
    holding and dragging the right mouse button with the SHIFT key held
    will create a circle, with center at the initial mouse click, and
    whose radius is the distance from the center to the current mouse
    position, in which all objects touching it will be selected.
  * there are 2 modes in which selecting multiple objects occurs.
    1. all objects touching the drawn out circle will be selected.
    2. all objects contained completely inside the drawn out circle
       will be selected.
    this selection mode can be toggled with the T key.
  * there are 4 modes which selection operates under, which are specified
    by holding different combinations of meta keys.
    1. set selection                    : SHIFT
    2. add to selection                 : SHIFT+CONTROL
    3. subtract from selection          : SHIFT+ALT
    4. toggle selection                 : SHIFT+CONTROL+ALT
  * performing any selection action when the CONTROL key is held down
    will toggle the effected objects' selection state.
  * all objects in the current layer can be selected by pressing the A key.
  * the current selection can be inverted by pressing the I key.
  * the selection set can be cleared by pressing the N key.

= OBJECT EDITING MODES
  * there are 3 modes to editing the physical properties of objects:
    1. transformation (position, scaling, rotation)
    2. linear velocity (vector value)
    3. angular velocity (scalar value)
  * you can change editing mode by using the 1, 2, and 3 keys while
    holding the CONTROL key, to switch to the respective mode.
  * there is a notion of an "origin cursor" which is an origin in space
    which the user can reposition, which can be used as the origin for
    transformations and other calculations.  it will behave exactly like
    an entity object, except that it will use a bright blue bounding circle,
    and it will have a crosshairs for more accurate visualization of its
    center.  it will always be drawn the same size, no matter what the
    zoom factor is.  an option will be given which can disable selecting
    the origin cursor.
  * the origin cursor can be "attached" to an object, so that if the object
    is moved, the origin cursor stays on the origin of the object it is
    attached to.
  * transformation modes (which will be described in the scaling and
    rotation editing sections) can be changed to using the 1, 2 and 3
    keys respectively, while holding the ALT key.
  * basis vectors (more on this later).

= POSITION (TRANSLATION) EDITING - MODE 1
  * the position of selected objects can be changed in this mode.
  * holding and dragging the left mouse button with no meta buttons held
    will move (translate) all selected objects.
  * moving objects with the keyboard

= SCALE EDITING - MODE 1
  * the scale of selected objects can be changed in this mode.
  * holding and dragging the left mouse button while only the SHIFT key is
    held down will scale all selected objects using the current transformation
    method.
  * transformation methods:
    1. scale all selected objects' positions and scales using the origin
       cursor.  this method will also alter the positions of objects as
       they're scaled away/toward the origin cursor.
    2. scale all selected objects' positions and scales using the selection
       set's local origin (the average of all their positions).
    3. using each selected objects' respective origins.  the positions of
       each object will remain fixed.  only the scales of each object
       change.

= ROTATION EDITING - MODE 1
  * the angle of selected objects can be changed in this mode.
  * holding and dragging the left mouse button while only the CONTROL key
    is held down will rotate all selected objects using the current
    tranformation method.
  * transformation methods:
    1. using the origin cursor for all selected objects.  the selected
       objects themselves rotate, and the positions of the objects are
       rotated around the origin cursor.
    2. rotate all selected objects' positions and scales using the selection
       set's local origin (the average of all their positions).
    3. using each selected objects' respective origin.  the positions
       of the selected objects do not change.

= LINEAR VELOCITY EDITING - MODE 2
  * there are 3 modes of editing the linear velocity of an entity.
    1. holding and dragging the left mouse button with no meta buttons held
       will move the tip of the arrow vector around.  this will allow the
       user to change the velocity vector to anything (albeit imprecise).
       this method can only be used on a single entity at a time.
    2. holding and dragging the left mouse button with the SHIFT key is held
       down will scale the velocity vectors of all selected entities without
       changing their directions, using the origin cursor as the reference
       point.
    3. holding and dragging the left mouse button with the CONTROL key is held
       down will rotate the velocity vectors of all selected entities,
       without changing their lengths.

= ANGULAR VELOCITY EDITING - MODE 3
  * there are 2 modes for editing the angular velocity of an entity.
    1. holding and dragging the left mouse button with no meta buttons held
       will wind up/down the angular velocity arc in the direction that
       the mouse is dragged around the origin cursor.
    2. holding and dragging the left mouse button with the SHIFT key is held
       down will scale the angular velocity value for all selected entities,
       using the origin cursor as a reference point.

= EDITING USING SNAP-TO-GRID AND OTHER QUANTIZING MODES
  * there is a notion of "quanta" which is a positive real scalar value
    which is used to quantize other scalar values.  if Q is the quanta
    value, then quantizing another value using Q will give a value of
    k*Q where k is an integer, thus k*Q is the "quantized value".
  * there will be a "quantize positions" command which snaps all selected
    objects to the closest grid point using the current grid scale.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize movements" editing mode which
    quantizes movement deltas to the current grid scale, without snapping the
    actual origins of the objects to the grid points.  this mode effects
    object positioning only.
  * there will be a "quantize scales" command which quantizes the scale
    factors of all selected objects.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize scale changes" editing mode which
    quantizes the amounts by which the user can scale objects.
  * there will be a "quantize angles" command which quantizes the rotation
    angles of all selected objects.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize angle changes" editing mode which
    quantizes the amounts by which the user can rotate objects.
  * there will be a "quantize velocity magnitudes" command which quantizes
    the velocity vector lengths of all selected objects.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize velocity magnitude changes" editing
    mode which quantizes the amounts by which the user can change the lengths
    of the velocity vectors.
  * there will be a "quantize velocity angles" command which quantizes the
    angles of the velocity vectors of all selected objects.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize velocity angle changes" editing mode
    which quantizes the amounts by which the user can change the velocity
    vector angles.
  * there will be a "quantize angular velocities" command which quantizes
    the angular velocity values of all selected objects.
  * there will be a toggleable "quantize angular velocity changes" editing
    mode which quantizes the amounts by which the user can change the
    angular velocity values.

= DISPLAY PANELS
  * there will be a control panel to the side of the main map view panel which
    displays the properties of the selected objects/entities.  there will be 3
    sub-panels in this control panel:
    1. object properties
    2. entity properties
    3. selection set properties
    these will be described in the next 3 sections.
  * when there are no objects selected, both panels will be hidden (or
    possibly disabled).

= OBJECT PROPERTIES PANEL
  * the objects properties panel displays the properties of Objects (and
    subclasses of Object such as Entity).  the properties are:
    1. origin/position - there are 2 different
    2. scale - there are 2 different modes this works in
       A. if there is only one selected object, then it will show the object's
          scale factor plainly.
       B. if there are multiple objects selected, it will show the scale
          of the selection set -- the scale will be reset to 1.0 every time
          an object is

= TEST-RUNNING THE MAP
  * the F12 key will temporarily disengage editing mode and start the map
    running; the objects will move and rotate as specified by their preset
    initial conditions.
  * press F12 while in test-run mode to stop the test-run and go back
    to edit mode (resetting all the objects to the way they were before the
    test run).
  * state-saving-to-mapfile

= QUADTREES
  * though this is an engine-specific detail that i would like to keep out
    of sight from this scope of the project, it may be useful to be able
    to define custom quadtrees which are tailored to the map's specifics.
  * tesselating quadtree nodes.
  * detesselating quadtree nodes.
  * more on this later.
